          <p>Hello and welcome to my site. I'm Seb - founder of Answer.tv. Today is answer.tv's birthday - it is brand new (and still in beta so quite buggy - please bear with me
          while I sort out the gremblins).</p>
          <p>
            It seems to be the done thing amongst websites to push a creation story - mainly for PR purposes, for example the eBay story of Pierre Omidyar creating eBay to
            help his fianc√©e trade Pez candy dispensers was fabricated by a public relations manager in 1997 to interest the media, which were not interested
            in the company's previous explanation about wanting to create a "perfect market". Since my site is new and I need to drum up interest in the media, I've decided I need a good creation myth
            - contact us with any good ideas and we'll put the best ones up on this blog. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I created answer.tv as I wanted an easy way to for people to answer questions online. I also wanted people to be able to connect with the answers, in a way written text sometimes can't.
            After putting up a proof of concept last year, I forgot about it for a while, but revisited it a few months ago, taking the feedback I'd received from testers to redesign the site. 
          </p>
          <p>
           As this site it still very new, I'd be really keen to hear from anyone with feedback / comments as we'll be rolling out new features as the site grows, and I want the community to influence
           how it takes shape. So please feel free to ask me anything, and watch this space...
          </p>
